# Triage — Prompt-to-Skill Router

## §0 Model dispatch (FIRST STEP — execute before anything else)

This skill is declared `model: haiku`. If the executing agent is running on a model
strictly more expensive than the declared tier, you MUST self-dispatch before doing the
skill's actual work.

Detection:
  - Read your current model from the system context ("powered by the model named X").
  - Tier order: haiku < sonnet < opus.
  - Sentinel parsing: the user's prompt is checked for the `[no-redispatch]` family.
      * Bare `[no-redispatch]` (parent-emit form AND user manual override): skip dispatch, proceed to §1 at the current tier.
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:N]` where N is a positive integer ≥ 2: ABORT (see "Abort rule" below).
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:1]` is reserved and treated as bare `[no-redispatch]` for forward-compatibility; do not emit it.
  - If current_tier > declared_tier AND prompt does NOT start with any `[no-redispatch]` form:
      Dispatch reason: cost-guardrail handoff. dispatched-tier: haiku.
      Spawn an Agent subagent with the following arguments:
        model: "haiku"
        description: "triage dispatched at haiku tier"
        prompt: "[no-redispatch]\n<original user input verbatim>"
      Wait for the subagent. Return its output as your final response. STOP.
      (Return the subagent's output as your final response.)

Abort rule (recursion guard):
  - If the prompt starts with `[no-redispatch:N]` AND N ≥ 2: ABORT before any tool calls.
  - Print the one-line error: `Quoin self-dispatch hard-cap reached at N=<N> in triage. This indicates a recursion bug; aborting before any tool calls. Re-invoke with [no-redispatch] (bare) to override.`
  - Then stop. Do NOT proceed to §1.

Manual kill switch:
  - The user can prefix any user-typed slash invocation with bare `[no-redispatch]` to skip dispatch entirely (e.g., `[no-redispatch] /triage`).
  - This is the user-facing escape hatch and intentionally shares syntax with the parent-emit form: a child cannot tell whether the bare sentinel came from the parent or the user, and that is by design — both paths want the same proceed-to-§1 outcome.
  - Use this only when intentionally overriding the cost guardrail (e.g., for one-off debugging on a different tier).

Fail-graceful path (per architecture I-01):
  - If the harness's subagent-spawn tool is unavailable or returns an error during dispatch, do NOT abort the user's invocation.
  - Emit the one-line warning: `[quoin-stage-1: subagent dispatch unavailable; proceeding at current tier]`
  - Then proceed to §1 at the current tier. This is fail-OPEN on the cost guardrail (better to overspend than to abort the user's invocation).

Otherwise (already at or below declared tier, OR prompt has [no-redispatch] sentinel, OR dispatch unavailable): proceed to §1 (skill body).

## Summary

`/triage` is a lightweight routing skill. It reads a user's natural-language prompt, inspects the current workflow state on disk, scores each candidate skill against an embedded catalog, and presents a ranked proposal with rationale. After confirming the best-fit skill, `/triage` always tells the user which command to type — it **never invokes skills itself**. This applies to every skill, not just `/implement` and `/end_of_task`. The propose-only posture for all 18 routable skills is intentional and permanent: no `Skill` tool calls happen from `/triage` at any point.

---

## Session Bootstrap

`/triage` is a routing skill. It does minimal setup:

1. **CLAUDE.md is injected by the harness** — no explicit read is needed.
2. **Cost recording — explicit-only:** Record a cost-ledger entry ONLY if the user's prompt explicitly names a task folder (e.g., `/triage task=auth-refactor` or the prompt contains the exact folder name). In all other cases — including when exactly one non-reserved task folder exists — skip cost recording silently. This conservative policy prevents false ledger writes in multi-task-folder contexts.
3. **Session state:** `/triage` does NOT write `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/` files. Routing is not "meaningful work" in the session-state rule sense.
4. **Trigger-phrase stripping** (see Step 1 below) happens before any scoring.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Strip trigger phrases

Before scoring, remove any exact match of the `/triage` description's trigger phrases (lowercased, trimmed) from the prompt. The trigger list to strip:

- "what should i run"
- "which skill fits this"
- "route this"
- "pick the right command for me"
- "i'm not sure what to do next"
- "/triage"

Stripping prevents the invocation phrase from polluting Signal B scoring. After stripping, normalize whitespace. The resulting text is the **scoring prompt**.

### Step 2: Collect workflow-state signals

Run the following checks. All are **best-effort and read-only** — if a command fails or a file is missing, treat the signal as "unknown" (0 points). Never error out. Evaluate once; do not re-evaluate mid-conversation. Active task folder checks **always exclude** `finalized/`, `memory/`, and `cache/` subdirectories.

| Signal | Detection | Skills boosted | Skills suppressed |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| No `.workflow_artifacts/` at project root | `ls .workflow_artifacts/ 2>/dev/null` returns empty/error | `/init_workflow` +2 | All task-execution skills −1 each |
| `repos-inventory.md` missing or >7 days old | `ls .workflow_artifacts/memory/repos-inventory.md 2>/dev/null` absent, or mtime >7 days (`stat -f %m` macOS / `stat -c %Y` Linux, fallback: treat absent as stale) | `/discover` +2 | `/architect`, `/plan`, `/thorough_plan` −1 each |
| At least one active task folder exists | `ls -d .workflow_artifacts/*/ 2>/dev/null` filtered: exclude `finalized/`, `memory/`, `cache/` | `/review`, `/implement`, `/gate` +1 each | `/init_workflow` −2 |
| Plan found at any depth under active task folder(s) | `find .workflow_artifacts -maxdepth 4 -name current-plan.md -not -path '*/finalized/*' -not -path '*/cache/*' -not -path '*/memory/*' 2>/dev/null` returns any result | `/implement` +2, `/critic` +1 (if no `critic-response-*.md` found near it) | `/plan` −1, `/thorough_plan` −1 |
| Plan found AND recent commits AND no `review-*.md` | Plan found (above) + `git log --since=1.day --oneline 2>/dev/null` non-empty + `find .workflow_artifacts -maxdepth 4 -name 'review-*.md' -not -path '*/finalized/*' 2>/dev/null` returns nothing | `/review` +2 | `/plan` −1, `/thorough_plan` −1 |
| `review-*.md` with verdict APPROVED | `grep -rl "APPROVED" .workflow_artifacts/*/review-*.md 2>/dev/null` non-empty | `/end_of_task` +2 | `/review` −1 |
| Uncommitted changes on current repo | `git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null` non-empty | `/implement` +1 | `/end_of_task` −1 (unless APPROVED) |
| On `main`/`master` with clean working tree | `git status 2>/dev/null` clean + `git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null` is `main` or `master` | `/start_of_day` +1, `/thorough_plan` +1 | `/end_of_task` −2 |
| Today's daily cache exists | `ls .workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md 2>/dev/null` found | `/end_of_day` +1 | `/start_of_day` −1 |
| No daily cache for today AND no session file for today | Daily cache absent + `ls .workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-*.md 2>/dev/null` absent | `/start_of_day` +2 | — |
| Active session file with `Status: in_progress` | `grep -l "Status: in_progress" .workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-*.md 2>/dev/null` non-empty | `/implement` +1, `/review` +1 | `/init_workflow` −2 |
| It's Friday (local date) | `date +%u 2>/dev/null` == 5 (uses local timezone — correct; `date +%u` respects the system clock) | `/weekly_review` +1 | — |
| Knowledge cache stale (>7 days) | `stat -f %m .workflow_artifacts/cache/_staleness.md 2>/dev/null` (macOS) or `stat -c %Y` (Linux) > 7 days, or file absent | `/discover` +1 | — |

### Step 3: Classify against the skill catalog

Apply the three-signal scoring algorithm:

**Signal A — Explicit command.** If the scoring prompt contains a literal `/<skill-name>` token matching any of the 18 routable skills (case-insensitive), that skill gets score **3** and skip directly to Step 4 proposal. No further scoring needed.

- Special rule: if `/revise-fast` is matched via Signal A, substitute `/revise` in the proposal with note: "`/revise-fast` is an internal variant; proposing `/revise` instead."
- `/revise-fast` is **never** included in any ranked list or ambiguous candidate display.

**Signal B — Trigger phrase match.** Match the scoring prompt (lowercased, whitespace-normalized) against the `Trigger phrases` column in the catalog (Section 6). Each exact phrase match = **2 points**. Each partial primary keyword match = **1 point**. Sum per skill.

**Signal C — Workflow state.** Apply the boost/suppress values from Step 2 to each skill's running total.

### Step 4: Rank candidates

Sort skills by total score (Signal B + Signal C) descending.

- **Single winner:** Top skill score ≥ runner-up by ≥ 2 points → single-candidate flow.
- **Ambiguous:** Top N candidates within 1 point, N ∈ {2, 3} → ambiguous-candidate flow.
- **Decline:** No skill scores above 1, OR N > 3 candidates tied, OR top candidates all have "High" impact with no disambiguating state signal → decline flow.

### Step 5: Present proposal

See Section 9 (Ambiguity Handling) for the exact dialogue format.

### Step 6: Handle confirmation

Once the user confirms any skill from any flow:

1. Print: `→ Type /<skill-name> to proceed.`
2. Stop. Do **not** call the `Skill` tool. This applies universally — no exceptions.

For decline/negation replies, apply the one-question cap (Section 9).

## Section 7: Cross-Skill Disambiguation Table

When keyword collisions produce a tie, use state signals to break it. These rules layer on top of the catalog scores.

| Keyword(s) | Competing skills | Disambiguator |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| "plan", "break down" | `/plan`, `/thorough_plan`, `/revise`, `/critic` | No plan exists → boost `/thorough_plan` +1, suppress `/revise` −2, suppress `/critic` −2. Plan exists → suppress `/thorough_plan` −1; boost `/revise` +1 if `critic-response-*.md` exists. |
| "review", "check", "look at" | `/review`, `/critic`, `/weekly_review` | Plan + recent commits → boost `/review` +2, suppress `/critic` −2, suppress `/weekly_review` −2. No recent commits, no plan → boost `/critic` +1. Day is Friday → boost `/weekly_review` +1. |
| "implement", "code", "write" | `/implement`, `/run` | No plan found → suppress `/implement` −2, boost `/thorough_plan` +1. Plan found + no review → boost `/implement` +1. |
| "commit", "ship", "push", "done", "finish" | `/end_of_task`, `/implement` | APPROVED review found → boost `/end_of_task` +2, suppress `/implement` −1. No review yet → suppress `/end_of_task` −2, boost `/implement` +1. |
| "start", "begin", "morning", "resume" | `/start_of_day`, `/thorough_plan`, `/init_workflow` | No daily cache today → boost `/start_of_day` +2. Task folder exists → suppress `/init_workflow` −2. |
| "run", "everything", "full pipeline" | `/run`, `/thorough_plan` | Any uncommitted work or no plan → suppress `/run` −1. User says "full" or "end to end" → boost `/run` +1. |

---

## Section 8: Invocation Policy

**All 18 routable skills are propose-only.** After the user confirms, `/triage` prints the command to type and stops. No `Skill` tool call is ever made.

**Rationale:**
- No Haiku skill in this workflow uses the `Skill` tool. Only Opus orchestrators (`/run`, `/thorough_plan`) invoke other skills via `Skill` tool dispatch. Running a `Skill` tool call from a Haiku model is unverified and potentially unsupported.
- Universal propose-only eliminates this uncertainty entirely. It also means no exception clauses are needed in any target skill's SKILL.md (per lessons 2026-04-13 and 2026-04-14: when a skill adds exception clauses, the *target* skill's SKILL.md must be updated too — universal propose-only sidesteps this entirely).
- User friction is minimal: the user sees the proposed command and types it.

| Skill | Impact level | Rationale for propose-only |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `/architect` | Medium | Universal propose-only. User types `/architect`. |
| `/capture_insight` | Low | Universal propose-only. |
| `/cost_snapshot` | Low | Universal propose-only; read-only. |
| `/critic` | Medium | Universal propose-only. |
| `/discover` | Medium | Universal propose-only. |
| `/end_of_day` | Low | Universal propose-only. |
| `/end_of_task` | **High** | Hard rule in CLAUDE.md — explicit invocation only. Universal policy reinforces this. Per lessons 2026-04-13/2026-04-14. |
| `/gate` | Medium | Universal propose-only; additionally a context-sensitive checkpoint — user should consciously invoke. |
| `/implement` | **High** | Hard rule in CLAUDE.md — explicit invocation only. Universal policy reinforces this. Per lessons 2026-04-13/2026-04-14. |
| `/init_workflow` | Low | Universal propose-only. |
| `/plan` | Medium | Universal propose-only. |
| `/review` | Medium | Universal propose-only. |
| `/revise` | Medium | Universal propose-only. |
| `/rollback` | **High** | Destructive — reverts commits. Universal policy reinforces safety. |
| `/run` | **High** | Full pipeline; huge scope. Universal policy reinforces deliberate invocation. |
| `/start_of_day` | Low | Universal propose-only. |
| `/thorough_plan` | Medium | Universal propose-only. Standard planning entry point. |
| `/weekly_review` | Low | Universal propose-only. |

`/revise-fast` is NOT in this table — it is not a user-facing routing target.

## Section 9: Ambiguity Handling

### Single-candidate flow

```
Proposed skill: /name
Rationale: <one sentence citing the top 1-2 scoring signals>

→ Type /name to proceed, or say "different skill" to see alternatives.
```

**Reply handling:**
- "different skill" → re-enter with the next-highest candidate.
- Any reply containing a `/<cmd>` token (e.g., "/plan") → treat as Signal A short-circuit on that new command; re-classify.
- Affirmative reply (case-insensitive, ≤ 5 words, no `/<cmd>` token): "yes", "go", "do it", "ok", "sure", "proceed", "yep", "sounds good", "yeah", "correct" → print `→ Type /name to proceed.` and **stop**.
- Negation reply: "no", "cancel", "stop", "nope", "nevermind" → stop. Print: "Would you like to describe what you're trying to do, or type a specific /command?"

**Propose-only output (always):** After any affirmation, print `→ Type /skill-name to proceed.` Never call the `Skill` tool.

### Ambiguous-candidate flow

Triggers when top N candidates are within 1 point of each other, N ∈ {2, 3}.

```
Multiple candidates match your request. Ranked:

1) /first  — <rationale + top signal>
2) /second — <rationale + top signal>
3) /third  — <rationale + top signal>  (only if N=3)

Which would you like? (type a number, describe more, or type the command directly)
```

**Reply handling:**
- "1", "2", or "3" → proceed as single-candidate flow for that skill.
- Reply containing `/<cmd>` → Signal A short-circuit; re-classify.
- Free-text → re-classify with new text appended. If still ambiguous, ask **ONE** clarifying question (hard cap):
  > "Are you planning new work, reviewing existing work, or wrapping up a completed task?"
- If the response to that one question is still ambiguous or vague → **hard exit**: "I couldn't determine which skill fits — please type the command directly or run `/help` to see available skills." No further iteration.

### Decline flow

Triggers when no skill scores above 1, OR N > 3 candidates tied, OR top candidates all have High impact with no disambiguating state signal.

```
I'm not sure which skill fits. Could you clarify:

- Are you planning, implementing, reviewing, or wrapping up?
- Is this a new task or continuation of an existing one?
```

One question cycle only. If still ambiguous → **hard exit**: "Please type the command directly, or run `/help` to see available skills."

---

## Section 10: Edge Cases & Guardrails

**Explicit-command short-circuit (Signal A):** If the scoring prompt (after trigger-phrase stripping) contains a literal `/<skill-name>` token, bypass all other scoring. Propose that skill immediately with score 3. Exception: `/revise-fast` → substitute `/revise` with note.

**Multi-stage plan detection:** The plan existence signal uses recursive `find` (maxdepth 4) — not flat file existence. This correctly handles the stage-subfolder layout from lesson 2026-04-18 (e.g., `.workflow_artifacts/memory-cache/stage-2/current-plan.md`).

**Multi-task-folder handling:** When multiple active task folders exist and the user's prompt does not name one, state signals read across all folders (e.g., "any plan found" fires if any folder has a plan). Cost recording is skipped silently.

**Trigger-phrase stripping:** The stripping in Step 1 is case-insensitive and trimmed. Only exact phrase matches are stripped — not substrings. After stripping, normalize whitespace.

**`revise-fast` hidden:** Never appear in ranked lists, ambiguous candidate lists, or proposals. If Signal A matches `/revise-fast`, substitute `/revise` with the note: "`/revise-fast` is an internal variant; proposing `/revise` instead."

**Error-tolerant state checks:** Every shell command in Step 2 appends `2>/dev/null`. Failed checks contribute 0 points. `/triage` never errors out due to a missing file or failed command.

**One-clarification-question hard cap:** Across all flows (single, ambiguous, decline), `/triage` asks at most one clarifying question per session. If still ambiguous after that one question, always hard exit. No loops.

**`/triage` on itself:** If the user types `/triage` as their prompt, Signal A fires immediately and proposes `/triage` (a self-referential loop). Handle this gracefully: print "You're already running `/triage`. Please describe what you're trying to accomplish so I can route you to the right skill."

---

## Section 11: Important Behaviors

- **Never call the `Skill` tool.** This is a hard constraint, not a preference. Universal propose-only for all 18 skills.
- **Scoring prompt is stripped input.** Always score the trigger-phrase-stripped, whitespace-normalized prompt — never the raw input.
- **State signals are evaluated once** at bootstrap. Do not re-evaluate mid-conversation.
- **`/revise-fast` is invisible to users.** Never surface it in any output.
- **When adding a new skill to the workflow, append a row to the catalog in Section 6.** The catalog is the routing source of truth — without a row, the skill is unroutable via `/triage`.
- **`/triage` is not a gate.** It does not block phase transitions. It is a convenience router, not a checkpoint.
- **Propose-only output is always the same format:** `→ Type /skill-name to proceed.` Consistency helps users trust the output and know they must type the command.
