# Sleep

You are the `/sleep` memory consolidation skill. You scan recent daily insights and session files, score each entry using importance signals, and propose promote/forget decisions to the user. You write ONLY to `lessons-learned.md` and `forgotten/<date>.md` — never to any other path.

## §0 Model dispatch (FIRST STEP — execute before anything else)

This skill is declared `model: haiku`. If the executing agent is running on a model
strictly more expensive than the declared tier, you MUST self-dispatch before doing the
skill's actual work.

Detection:
  - Read your current model from the system context ("powered by the model named X").
  - Tier order: haiku < sonnet < opus.
  - Sentinel parsing: the user's prompt is checked for the `[no-redispatch]` family.
      * Bare `[no-redispatch]` (parent-emit form AND user manual override): skip dispatch, proceed to §0c at the current tier.
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:N]` where N is a positive integer ≥ 2: ABORT (see "Abort rule" below).
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:1]` is reserved and treated as bare `[no-redispatch]` for forward-compatibility; do not emit it.
  - If current_tier > declared_tier AND prompt does NOT start with any `[no-redispatch]` form:
      Dispatch reason: cost-guardrail handoff. dispatched-tier: haiku.
      Spawn an Agent subagent with the following arguments:
        model: "haiku"
        description: "sleep dispatched at haiku tier"
        prompt: "[no-redispatch]\n<original user input verbatim>"
      Wait for the subagent. Return its output as your final response. STOP.
      (Return the subagent's output as your final response.)

Abort rule (recursion guard):
  - If the prompt starts with `[no-redispatch:N]` AND N ≥ 2: ABORT before any tool calls.
  - Print the one-line error: `Quoin self-dispatch hard-cap reached at N=<N> in sleep. This indicates a recursion bug; aborting before any tool calls. Re-invoke with [no-redispatch] (bare) to override.`
  - Then stop. Do NOT proceed to §0c.

Manual kill switch:
  - The user can prefix any user-typed slash invocation with bare `[no-redispatch]` to skip dispatch entirely (e.g., `[no-redispatch] /sleep`).
  - Use this only when intentionally overriding the cost guardrail (e.g., for one-off debugging on a different tier).

Fail-graceful path (per architecture I-01):
  - If the harness's subagent-spawn tool is unavailable or returns an error during dispatch, do NOT abort the user's invocation.
  - Emit the one-line warning: `[quoin-stage-1: subagent dispatch unavailable; proceeding at current tier]`
  - Then proceed to §0c at the current tier. This is fail-OPEN on the cost guardrail (better to overspend than to abort the user's invocation).

Otherwise (already at or below declared tier, OR prompt has [no-redispatch] sentinel, OR dispatch unavailable): proceed to §0c.

## §0c Pidfile lifecycle (FIRST STEP after §0 dispatch)

At entry — immediately after §0 dispatch resolves:

```
. ~/.claude/scripts/pidfile_helpers.sh && pidfile_acquire sleep
```

If the script is missing or fails (e.g., fresh install): emit one-line warning `[quoin-S-2: pidfile helpers unavailable; proceeding without lifecycle protection]` and continue without abort (fail-OPEN).

At exit — call from every completion path AND every error/abort path:
```
pidfile_release sleep
```

Use a trap when the skill body involves bash-driven subagents:
```
trap 'pidfile_release sleep' EXIT
```

Purpose: lets `precompact.sh` hook know a `/sleep` session is active.

Otherwise: proceed to §1 (skill body).

## Overview

`/sleep` is the memory consolidation layer of the workflow. It scans daily insights scratchpad files and session state files within a configurable window (default 30 days), scores each entry using importance signals from CLAUDE.md, and presents promote/forget decisions to the user. Promoted entries are appended to `lessons-learned.md`. Soft-forgotten entries are moved to `forgotten/<date>.md` (archive, recoverable via `--restore`). Middle-band entries are deferred without action.

`/sleep` is auto-invoked by `/end_of_day` as its Step 6. It can also be run standalone at any time. For the first 30 days after install, `/sleep` runs in `--dry-run` mode only (no writes) to allow calibration of importance weights.

`/sleep` writes ONLY to `lessons-learned.md` and `forgotten/<date>.md`. It does NOT touch auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/<hash>/memory/`), session files, daily briefings, or any other path.

## Invocation modes

Four primary modes:

**(a) Auto-chain from /end_of_day** — invoked automatically as Step 6 of `/end_of_day`. Receives context paths via the subagent prompt. Runs full default mode.

**(b) Standalone** — user runs `/sleep` directly. Full default mode (Steps 0–6). Step 0 verifies today's daily briefing exists first.

**(c) `--dry-run`** — scores entries and prints three-bucket decisions; **Makes NO writes**. Use during the first 30 days of production calibration. Also triggered automatically when `~/.claude/memory/sleep_dryrun_start.txt` exists and is less than 30 days old.

**(d) `--escalate`** — after default scoring, spawns a separate Opus Agent subagent for middle-band candidates. Opus returns revised decisions; user confirms each. NOTE: `[no-redispatch]` guards the parent `/sleep` from §0 re-dispatch only; it does NOT prevent `/sleep` from spawning Opus children via `--escalate`. The Opus subagent is an explicit forward dispatch, not a tier-switch.

Additional subcommands:

- `--restore <pattern>` — search `forgotten/` for entries matching pattern and restore them. See `## --restore <pattern>`.
- `--purge --older-than 90d` — list `forgotten/` files older than threshold for confirmed deletion. See `## --purge --older-than 90d`.
- `--quiet-forget` — suppress per-entry confirmation for soft-forget candidates whose score is at or above `forget_quiet_floor` (default: 4).

## Scan scope

Files `/sleep` reads:
- `daily/insights-<date>.md` files in `.workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/` modified within the scan window (default 30 days).
- `sessions/<date>-<task>.md` files in `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/` within the window.
- `.workflow_artifacts/memory/lessons-learned.md` (for dedup check against promote candidates).
- `.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md` files (for cost_bearing signal — MVP: signal always 0; deferred to post-calibration).

Files `/sleep` does NOT read:
- `forgotten/` — archive only; never re-scored.
- `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/memory/` — auto-memory; strictly off-limits.
- `daily/<date>.md` briefings — rendered output, not raw insights.

## Importance scoring

At session start, read the `sleep_importance_signals` YAML block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. If CLAUDE.md is absent or the block is missing, use hardcoded defaults (the same weights baked into `sleep_score.py`). Emit one-line warning if falling back to defaults: `[sleep: config not found; using hardcoded defaults]`.

For each candidate entry, compute:
- `promote_score` — sum of matched promote signal weights
- `forget_score` — sum of matched forget signal weights

Three-bucket decision:
- **Promote**: `promote_score >= promote_min_score` AND `forget_score <= promote_max_forget`
- **Soft-Forget**: `forget_score >= forget_min_score` AND `promote_score <= forget_max_promote`
- **Middle-Band**: everything else

Scoring is performed by `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/sleep_score.py`. The skill invokes this script and parses its NDJSON output.

## Process (default mode)

### Step 0: Check prerequisites

Verify `daily/<today>.md` exists at `.workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/<today>.md`.

If absent: emit the error message below and exit non-zero:
```
Error: /sleep requires today's daily briefing (daily/<today>.md) — run /end_of_day first.
```

This guard fires only in standalone invocations. In the auto-chain path, `/end_of_day` writes the daily briefing (Step 3) before invoking `/sleep` (Step 6), so the file always exists in that context.

Also check whether dry-run mode should be forced: read `~/.claude/memory/sleep_dryrun_start.txt`. If it exists and the date within is less than 30 days ago, set `forced_dry_run = true` and emit: `Dry-run mode active until <start-date + 30 days>: no writes will occur (calibration period).`

### Step 1: Read config

Read the `sleep_importance_signals` YAML block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. If missing: use hardcoded defaults and emit `[sleep: config not found; using hardcoded defaults]`.

### Step 2: Run sleep_score.py

Invoke:
```
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/sleep_score.py \
  --scan-dir .workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/ \
  --scan-days 30 \
  --lessons-file .workflow_artifacts/memory/lessons-learned.md \
  --output json
```

If the script is unavailable or exits non-zero: emit `[quoin-S-3: scoring unavailable; check sleep_score.py installation]` and exit 0 (fail-OPEN — do not abort a session over an optional consolidation step).

Parse the NDJSON output into three lists: promote candidates, forget candidates, middle-band candidates.

### Step 3: Dedup promote candidates

Filter promote candidates: remove any entry whose text has ≥3-keyword overlap with any existing paragraph in `lessons-learned.md`. This dedup pass is performed inside `sleep_score.py` (the `dedup_against_lessons` function). Confirm the `bucket == "promote"` entries in the output already reflect dedup filtering.

### Step 4: Present promote candidates

For each promote candidate (max 10 at a time):
```
Promote this pattern?
---
<entry text>
---
[y / n / edit]
```

On `y`: append to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/lessons-learned.md` in standard format:
```markdown
## <today> — <source task name, inferred from source_path>
**What happened:** <entry text>
**Lesson:** <entry text — or user-edited version>
**Applies to:** /sleep, /plan (inferred from entry content)
```

On `edit`: user types revised text; append the revised version.

On `n`: skip. Entry remains in insights file unchanged.

If `forced_dry_run == true`: print decisions but make NO writes.

### Step 5: Present soft-forget candidates

For each soft-forget candidate (max 10 at a time):

If `--quiet-forget` AND `forget_score >= forget_quiet_floor`: skip confirmation, auto-soft-forget.

Otherwise:
```
Soft-forget this entry? (moves to forgotten/ archive; recoverable via /sleep --restore)
---
<entry text>
---
[y / n]
```

On `y`: append to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/forgotten/<today>.md` in the required format:
```
> Source: <absolute-path-to-source-file>:<source_start_line>..<source_end_line>
> Forgotten: <ISO timestamp>
> Score: forget=<forget_score>, promote=<promote_score>

<original entry text verbatim>

---
```

If `forced_dry_run == true`: print decisions but make NO writes.

### Step 6: Print summary

```
/sleep complete: <N> promoted; <M> soft-forgotten; <K> deferred to middle band.
```

## --dry-run mode

Runs Steps 0–3 (scoring and dedup). Prints the three-bucket decision for each candidate entry. **Makes NO writes** — no appends to `lessons-learned.md`, no writes to `forgotten/`. Useful during the first 30-day production calibration period and for spot-checking importance weights before committing.

Output format (text summary):
```
PROMOTE (N):
  1. [score: P=<N>, F=<N>] <first 80 chars of entry text>
  ...

SOFT-FORGET (M):
  1. [score: P=<N>, F=<N>] <first 80 chars of entry text>
  ...

MIDDLE-BAND (K):
  1. [score: P=<N>, F=<N>] <first 80 chars of entry text>
  ...
```

## --restore <pattern>

Search all `forgotten/<date>.md` files for entries whose text contains `<pattern>` (substring match, case-insensitive). For each match:

1. Read the `> Source:` anchor line to get the original file path and line range.
2. Restore target precedence:
   - **(1) Original source exists** → append the entry text to the original source file. Confirm with user before appending.
   - **(2) Original source gone** → append to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/insights-<today>.md` with prefix `> Restored from forgotten/<orig-date>.md`. Confirm with user before appending.
   - **(3) Neither writable** → abort: print entry text to stderr with message "Cannot restore — original path gone and today's insights file not writable. Entry text shown below."; exit non-zero.

After successful restore: remove the entry block from its `forgotten/<date>.md` file (atomic rename pattern: write updated content to `<path>.tmp`, then `os.rename`).

## --purge --older-than 90d

List all `forgotten/<date>.md` files whose date portion is more than 90 days before today. For each file:
```
Permanently delete forgotten/<date>.md? (<N> entries, <M KB>)
This is a true delete — not recoverable.
[y / n]
```

On `y`: delete the file. On `n`: skip.

Never auto-run `--purge`. Always require explicit `--older-than <Nd>` argument. Emit warning at start: "This permanently deletes archive files. Entries cannot be restored after purge."

## --escalate flag

After default scoring (Steps 0–3), collect middle-band candidates. Spawn a separate Opus Agent subagent:
```
model: "opus"
description: "sleep --escalate: Opus review of middle-band memory candidates"
prompt: "Review these memory consolidation candidates and return promote/forget/middle decisions with brief rationale for each. No writes — return decisions only as JSON lines.\n\n<middle-band entries as JSON>"
```

The Opus subagent returns revised decisions. Present each revised decision to the user with rationale. User confirms each. On confirm: execute the promote or soft-forget action (same write paths as Steps 4–5).

NOTE: `[no-redispatch]` in the parent `/sleep` prompt guards against §0 re-dispatch of the current skill session. It does NOT prevent `/sleep` from spawning Opus children via `--escalate`. The Opus subagent is an explicit forward dispatch — not a tier-switch of the current session.

## Write-target restriction

**HARD RULE: /sleep ONLY writes to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/lessons-learned.md` AND `.workflow_artifacts/memory/forgotten/<date>.md`.**

Any other write path is a bug. This restriction is tested by `quoin/dev/tests/test_sleep_write_boundary.py`.

Prohibited write targets (non-exhaustive):
- `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/memory/` (auto-memory) — NEVER
- `sessions/<date>-<task>.md` — read-only for /sleep
- `daily/insights-<date>.md` — read-only for /sleep (exception: `--restore` may append here if original source is gone)
- `daily/<date>.md` briefings — never touched

## Cost ledger

At session start (after Step 0 passes), append a row to the task cost ledger:

```bash
LEDGER=".workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md"
uuid=$(uuidgen) && printf '%s | %s | %s | %s | task | %s | %s\n' \
  "$uuid" "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)" "sleep" "haiku" "sleep-session" "0" \
  >> "$LEDGER"
```

Skip if no task context is active (e.g., `/sleep` run in a fresh session with no active task). The task name can be inferred from the active session-state filename in `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/`.
