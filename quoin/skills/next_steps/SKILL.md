# Next Steps

Manages an append-only queue of future work items in `next-steps.md`.

## §0 Model dispatch (FIRST STEP — execute before anything else)

This skill is declared `model: haiku`. If the executing agent is running on a model
strictly more expensive than the declared tier, you MUST self-dispatch before doing the
skill's actual work.

Detection:
  - Read your current model from the system context ("powered by the model named X").
  - Tier order: haiku < sonnet < opus.
  - Sentinel parsing: the user's prompt is checked for the `[no-redispatch]` family.
      * Bare `[no-redispatch]` (parent-emit form AND user manual override): skip dispatch, proceed to §1 at the current tier.
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:N]` where N is a positive integer ≥ 2: ABORT (see "Abort rule" below).
      * Counter form `[no-redispatch:1]` is reserved and treated as bare `[no-redispatch]` for forward-compatibility; do not emit it.
  - If current_tier > declared_tier AND prompt does NOT start with any `[no-redispatch]` form:
      Dispatch reason: cost-guardrail handoff. dispatched-tier: haiku.
      Spawn an Agent subagent with the following arguments:
        model: "haiku"
        description: "next_steps dispatched at haiku tier"
        prompt: "[no-redispatch]\n<original user input verbatim>"
      Wait for the subagent. Return its output as your final response. STOP.
      (Return the subagent's output as your final response.)

Abort rule (recursion guard):
  - If the prompt starts with `[no-redispatch:N]` AND N ≥ 2: ABORT before any tool calls.
  - Print the one-line error: `Quoin self-dispatch hard-cap reached at N=<N> in next_steps. This indicates a recursion bug; aborting before any tool calls. Re-invoke with [no-redispatch] (bare) to override.`
  - Then stop. Do NOT proceed to §1.

Manual kill switch:
  - The user can prefix any user-typed slash invocation with bare `[no-redispatch]` to skip dispatch entirely (e.g., `[no-redispatch] /next-steps`).
  - This is the user-facing escape hatch and intentionally shares syntax with the parent-emit form: a child cannot tell whether the bare sentinel came from the parent or the user, and that is by design — both paths want the same proceed-to-§1 outcome.
  - Use this only when intentionally overriding the cost guardrail (e.g., for one-off debugging on a different tier).

Fail-graceful path (per architecture I-01):
  - If the harness's subagent-spawn tool is unavailable or returns an error during dispatch, do NOT abort the user's invocation.
  - Emit the one-line warning: `[quoin-stage-1: subagent dispatch unavailable; proceeding at current tier]`
  - Then proceed to §1 at the current tier. This is fail-OPEN on the cost guardrail (better to overspend than to abort the user's invocation).

Otherwise (already at or below declared tier, OR prompt has [no-redispatch] sentinel, OR dispatch unavailable): proceed to §1 (skill body).

## Session bootstrap

Cost tracking note: `/next-steps` is a lightweight queue-management skill. Append to the cost ledger only when a task context is clearly active; use phase `next-steps`. If in doubt, skip cost recording.

If a task context is active: append your session to `.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md` (see cost tracking rules in CLAUDE.md) — phase: `next-steps`.

## Subcommand parsing

Parse the user's input (everything after the `/next-steps` invocation text) as follows:

- If the input matches `done <integer>` (regex `^done\s+\d+\s*$`) → `done` subcommand; extract N as the integer.
- If the input is exactly `list` or `list --all` → `list` subcommand.
- Everything else (including a bare invocation with trailing text) → `add` subcommand, using the entire trailing text verbatim as the entry text.

## Process

### Shared: resolve project root

Before any subcommand, resolve the project root by walking up from `cwd` looking for `.workflow_artifacts/` then `.git/`. If neither is found at cwd or any parent, emit:

```
error: cannot resolve project root (no .workflow_artifacts/ or .git/ found); refusing to write
```

and stop. Target file: `<project-root>/next-steps.md`.

### add TEXT

1. Trim leading/trailing whitespace from TEXT. If empty after trim, emit `error: empty entry text` and stop.
2. Read the full content of `next-steps.md` (create empty if it doesn't exist).
3. If `## Queue` heading is absent from any line: ensure the file ends with a single newline, then append `\n## Queue\n\n`.
4. Append the line: `- ⏳ YYYY-MM-DD: <text>` where date is the output of `date -u +%Y-%m-%d`.
5. Write back atomically: write full content to `<path>.tmp`, then `mv <path>.tmp <path>`.
6. Confirm: `Queued: ⏳ YYYY-MM-DD: <text>`

### list [--all]

1. Read `next-steps.md`. If absent, print `(no queue yet — use /next-steps add <text>)` and stop.
2. Locate `## Queue` heading. If absent, print `(no queue yet — use /next-steps add <text>)` and stop.
3. Walk lines from heading + 1 to EOF:
   - `pending` = lines whose stripped form starts with `- ⏳ `
   - `done_items` = lines whose stripped form starts with `- ✓ `
4. Print pending lines numbered 1..N (one per line). If none: print `(queue is empty)`.
5. With `--all` and done_items non-empty: print a blank line, `Done:`, then done_items unnumbered.

### done N

Full R-01 bracket procedure (load-bearing — prevents edits above `## Queue` heading):

```
read full file content into 'lines' (list of strings, no trailing newlines)
heading_idx = first index i where lines[i].rstrip() == "## Queue"
if heading_idx is None:
  print("error: ## Queue heading not found in next-steps.md; refusing to edit")
  exit non-zero
counter = 0
matched_idx = None
matched_line = None
for i in range(heading_idx + 1, len(lines)):
  if lines[i].lstrip().startswith("- ⏳ "):
    counter += 1
    if counter == N:
      matched_idx = i
      matched_line = lines[i]
      break
if matched_idx is None:
  print(f"error: only {counter} pending entries; cannot mark {N}")
  exit non-zero
print(f"match: line {matched_idx + 1}: {matched_line}")
new_line = matched_line.replace("⏳", "✓", 1)
lines[matched_idx] = new_line
write '\n'.join(lines) + '\n' to <path>.tmp
mv <path>.tmp <path>
print(f"Marked done: {new_line}")
```

## Important behaviors

- **Fast.** This skill completes in seconds. One read, one write.
- **Bracket is non-negotiable.** Never edit lines above the `## Queue` heading. If the heading is absent when `done N` is called, refuse with an error — do not fall back to a global search.
- **Atomic writes.** Always write to `<path>.tmp` then `mv <path>.tmp <path>` for all mutations.
- **Show the match before editing.** For `done N`, always print the matched line before mutating the file so the user sees what will change.
- **Reject empty text.** For `add`, reject empty or whitespace-only text with a one-line error.
