# Format Kit — v3 Artifact Writing Reference

This file is the v3 content-type-aware writing reference for all quoin skills. It is a Tier 1 hand-edited English file — never apply terse-style compression to it (doing so would break the format-picking guidance it encodes).

**Relationship to `terse-rubric.md`:** The rubric governs prose discipline *inside* prose sections. The format kit picks *which* sections are prose vs. structured. Both files work together: pick a primitive here, then apply the rubric inside prose-shaped primitives. References deployed copy at `~/.claude/memory/terse-rubric.md`.

**Architecture reference:** artifact-format-architecture v3 §5.1 (see `.workflow_artifacts/artifact-format-architecture/architecture.md`).

## §1 Primitives (the toolbox)

Seven primitives are available. Skills MUST pick the primitive that fits the section's content type. Skills MUST NOT use prose where a structured primitive fits.

### The seven primitives

**1. YAML** — key/value pairs or flat status snapshots.

Example:
```yaml
status: in_progress
stage: implement task 4 of 7
model: opus
```

**2. Markdown table** — three or more items with parallel attributes.

Example:
```markdown
| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|----|------|-----------|--------|
| R-01 | DB migration fails | Medium | High |
```

**3. Terse numbered list** — a sequence with state per item, or ordered steps. Use status glyphs for per-item state.

Example:
```
1. ✓ T-01: Create format-kit.md
2. ⏳ T-02: Create glossary.md
3. pending T-03: Extend install.sh
```

**4. Pseudo-code** — multi-step procedural logic, especially when ≥4 steps with conditionals.

Example:
```
if artifact_type == "current-plan":
  require_section("## For human")
  require_section("## State")
else:
  use_default_section_set()
```

**5. Caveman prose** — rationale, narrative, "why" explanations. Apply `terse-rubric.md` rules inside this primitive. Only use when content is genuinely narrative-shaped (cannot be tabulated or listed).

**6. XML tag** — when a downstream skill MUST extract a single field programmatically. Wrap the value:
```
<verdict>PASS</verdict>
```
Do not use XML tags for decorative structure; use only when machine-extraction is the goal.

**7. ID-based cross-references** — stable references across sections and artifacts. Use namespace prefixes:
- `D-NN` — decisions
- `T-NN` — tasks
- `R-NN` — risks
- `F-NN` — findings
- `Q-NN` — open questions
- `S-NN` — stages

**ID namespaces are file-local.** Definitions and references resolve within a single artifact only. To refer to a task or risk defined in a sibling artifact (e.g., a critic-response referring to a plan task, or a Stage N plan referring to a parent Stage N-1 task), use plain English ("the parent Stage 3 smoke task" or "the round-1 critic's CRIT-1 issue"), NOT a bare T-NN/CRIT-N token. The validator's V-05 invariant flags any [DTRFQS]-NN reference without a local definition.

### Pick rules (seven)

```
- If content is key/value pairs OR a flat status snapshot → YAML
- If content is ≥3 items with parallel attributes → markdown table
- If content is a sequence with state per item → terse numbered list with status glyph
- If content is multi-step procedural logic → pseudo-code (preferred when ≥4 steps with conditionals)
  OR terse numbered list (≤4 linear steps with no branching)
- If content is rationale/narrative/why → caveman prose per terse-rubric.md
- If a downstream skill MUST extract a single field → wrap in XML tag <field-name>...</field-name>
- For cross-references → use stable IDs (D-NN, T-NN, R-NN, F-NN, Q-NN, S-NN)
```

### Status glyphs

The four status glyphs are load-bearing for sequenced-items sections. Downstream skills (`/critic`, `/implement`, `/review`) may grep them to extract task state. Use verbatim — do not substitute variants:

| Glyph | Meaning | VERBATIM-keep |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| ✓ | done / completed | yes |
| ✗ | failed | yes |
| ⏳ | pending / in-progress | yes |
| 🚫 | blocked (waiting on external dependency) | yes |

## §2 Standard sections per artifact type

For each artifact type, the sections below list: required vs. optional status, the format primitive, and a one-line description. The `class` field (A or B) determines whether a `## For human` Haiku summary is required.

Machine-readable sidecar: `quoin/memory/format-kit.sections.json` (consumed by `validate_artifact.py` invariants V-02 and V-07).

## §3 Pick rules for ambiguous content (the hard cases)

Three rules for situations where the primitive choice is non-obvious:

1. **Mixed content in one logical section** — split into multiple sections, each homogeneous. Do not use prose to narrate over a list that should be a list. Example: if a "State" section has both a YAML snapshot and a prose rationale, put the YAML in `## State` and the rationale in `## Decisions`.

2. **A "decision with a list of consequences"** — Decision entry uses caveman prose body with an embedded bulleted consequence list. The consequence list is part of the decision body, not its own section. Example:
   ```
   ## Decisions
   Chose lazy-import for `anthropic` SDK (D-03).
   Consequences:
   - argparse and --help paths work without SDK installed
   - smoke tests are CI-safe without credentials
   - T-07 acceptance criterion: `grep '^import anthropic'` returns no match at module scope
   ```

3. **A risk with a long mitigation procedure** — the risk table row references a Procedure entry (`see proc:R-02`) that lives in the Procedures section. Do not embed multi-step procedures inside a table cell. Keep the table cell to one line.

---

## §4 Default minimal section set

For any Class A artifact NOT in §2's enumerated list, the default is:

| Section | Status | Primitive | Description |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| frontmatter | OPTIONAL | YAML | path, hash, updated, updated_by, tokens |
| main content section | REQUIRED | Any primitive appropriate to content | The artifact's primary content |
| `## Notes` | OPTIONAL | Caveman prose or terse list | Additional context |

Class B artifacts that do not appear in §2 should be treated as Class A until a Stage 3+ update adds them to the enumerated list.

---

## §5 Composition with terse-rubric.md

**The composition rule (from architecture §5.1):** The format kit picks which sections are prose vs. structured. The rubric applies *inside* prose-shaped sections. They do not conflict — they operate at different levels.

Concretely:
- Format kit says: "this section is caveman prose."
- Rubric then governs that section's prose: no filler phrases, no hedging, short sentences, tense consistency.
- Format kit says: "this section is a markdown table."
- Rubric does not apply to table cells — structured primitives have their own discipline (column alignment, separator row, bounded cell content).

Reference the deployed copy of the rubric at `~/.claude/memory/terse-rubric.md` when writing prose-shaped sections. The terse-rubric.md and format-kit.md are co-required: reading one without the other gives an incomplete picture of what correct artifact writing looks like.
