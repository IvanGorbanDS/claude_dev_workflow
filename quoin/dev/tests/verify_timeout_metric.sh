# verify_timeout_metric.sh — Post-merge stream-idle timeout verification harness.
#
# Usage: bash verify_timeout_metric.sh [DAYS]
#   DAYS: lookback window in days (default: 7)
#
# Exits 0 (PASS) if ≤1 file with 'Stream idle timeout' in the last DAYS days.
# Exits 1 (FAIL) if >1 file (target metric exceeded).
#
# Day-0 sanity gate: on pre-merge baseline, this MUST report a non-zero count.
# If it reports 0 on day-0, the proc itself is broken — investigate before relying on it.
#
# Run daily for 14 days post-merge per proc:T-12-verify in the plan.
