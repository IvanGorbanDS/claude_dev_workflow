"""T-04: Static test that session-age guard is wired into end_of_task/SKILL.md.

T-09 extends this file with run/SKILL.md ordering assertions.

Checks:
  (a) §0b heading present in end_of_task/SKILL.md
  (b) Helper call present in end_of_task/SKILL.md
  (c) [no-session-age-guard] override sentinel present in end_of_task/SKILL.md
  (d) run/SKILL.md contains 'Pre-flight: session-age guard' heading (T-09 section)
  (e) [T-09] 'Pre-flight: session-age guard' heading appears AFTER
      '### Initialize cost ledger' and BEFORE '### Check git state' in run/SKILL.md
