"""T-12: pitfall-injection presence test.

Verifies that format-kit-pitfalls.md is injected exactly once into each of the
7 target SKILL.md files (architect, plan, revise, revise-fast, review, critic, gate)
and NOT present in the 4 non-target skills (capture_insight, implement, end_of_day,
start_of_day).

Per Stage 4 D-04-rev2: target iff (a) output IS validated by validate_artifact.py
AND (b) writer follows the §5.3 Class B 5-step pattern (or Class A variant with
retry-with-recomposition). /capture_insight is OUT despite being validated because
its V-failure path is log-and-continue with no body recomposition.
