"""
End-to-end structural smoke tests for path_resolve.py integration.

Deterministic — no live LLM, no git history, no clock.
Verifies that:
  - CLAUDE.md documents the multi-stage convention + resolver
  - All SKILL.md files that reference planning-artifact hardcodes also wire path_resolve.py
  - No residual hardcoded <task-name>/... planning-artifact paths remain post-T-05
  - The resolver routes explicit integer stages correctly
  - The resolver grandfathers each known in-flight production task
  - install.sh deploys path_resolve.py
  - Multi-match raises ValueError with the expected message

Run from project root:
