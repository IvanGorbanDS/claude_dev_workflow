"""T-13: fallback_fires increment spec test.

Verifies that the session-state fallback_fires increment instructions are present
at the correct sites in each SKILL.md file, per Stage 4 T-08.

Step 5 emit sites (6 skills + gate):
- architect, critic, revise, revise-fast, plan, review: canonical phrase
  "Before logging the `format-kit-skipped` warning, increment the session-state `fallback_fires`"
- gate: variant phrase
  "Before falling back to v2-style write, increment the session-state `fallback_fires`"

Step 2 retry sites (5 Class B writers: architect, plan, revise, revise-fast, review):
- canonical phrase "Before re-running Step 2, increment the session-state `fallback_fires`"
- Each insertion is followed (on the next non-blank line) by its verbatim Step 2 anchor.

Negative guard: capture_insight, end_of_day, start_of_day, implement must NOT carry
the Step 5 increment instruction.
