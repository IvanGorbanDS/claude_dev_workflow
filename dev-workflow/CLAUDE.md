# Development Workflow — Shared Rules

This file defines the common rules and behaviors shared across all development workflow skills: `/init_workflow`, `/discover`, `/architect`, `/plan`, `/critic`, `/revise`, `/thorough_plan` (orchestrator), `/run` (end-to-end orchestrator), `/gate`, `/implement`, `/review`, `/rollback`, `/end_of_task`, `/end_of_day`, `/start_of_day`, `/weekly_review`, `/cost_snapshot`, `/capture_insight`, and `/triage`.

## Working Rules

### Git & PR Safety
- **Never push to remote or create PRs outside of `/end_of_task`.** During implementation and review, only commit locally. Push happens as part of `/end_of_task` (which requires `/review` first). PR creation is always a separate explicit user action — never auto-create PRs.
- **Always start each new task on a fresh branch.** Commit current work, switch to main, fetch latest, then create the new branch.

### Communication
- **Keep multi-step workflow progress verbose.** When working through plans, implementations, or multi-round processes, provide status updates at each step. Don't go silent during long operations.

### Dev Workflow
- **Never place stage plans into `.workflow_artifacts/finalized/` until `/end_of_task` is explicitly run.** Plans stay in their working location until the user triggers finalization.

## Project structure

This workspace uses a multi-repo layout. Multiple repositories are cloned side-by-side in the project folder. When exploring the codebase, scan all directories at the root level to discover all repos/services.

## Task subfolder convention

All planning and review artifacts are stored under `.workflow_artifacts/` at the project root:
```
<project-folder>/.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/
```

Task names are descriptive, kebab-case, derived from the task description (e.g., `auth-refactor`, `payment-v2-migration`, `api-rate-limiting`). Ask the user for a name when it's not obvious from context.

When running parallel tasks, each gets its own subfolder. Never mix artifacts from different tasks in the same folder.

### Archiving completed work

When a task is finalized via `/end_of_task`, its folder is moved into `.workflow_artifacts/finalized/`:

- **Sub-task completed** — moves into `.workflow_artifacts/<parent-feature>/finalized/`:
  ```
  .workflow_artifacts/payment-v2/auth-retry/  →  .workflow_artifacts/payment-v2/finalized/auth-retry/
  ```
- **Entire feature completed** — moves into `.workflow_artifacts/finalized/`:
  ```
  .workflow_artifacts/payment-v2/  →  .workflow_artifacts/finalized/payment-v2/
  ```

This keeps both the project root and `.workflow_artifacts/` clean — only active task folders are visible at the top of `.workflow_artifacts/`. Completed work is preserved in `.workflow_artifacts/finalized/` for reference.

**IMPORTANT: Never move task folders into `.workflow_artifacts/finalized/` during planning or implementation.** Keep them in their working location throughout the entire workflow. The `finalized/` directory is reserved for completed, shipped work only. Artifacts are moved there exclusively when `/end_of_task` is explicitly invoked by the user.

## Workflow sequence

The intended flow depends on the task profile (Small / Medium / Large). `/thorough_plan` is the universal entry point — it triages and routes automatically.

### Full flow (Medium and Large tasks)

```
/discover → /architect → GATE → /thorough_plan → GATE → /implement → GATE → /review → GATE → /end_of_task
```

### Shortcut flow (Small tasks)

```
/thorough_plan (auto-routes to single-pass /plan) → GATE → /implement → GATE → /review → GATE → /end_of_task
```

Small tasks skip `/architect` and the critic loop. `/thorough_plan` detects the Small profile (via `small:` tag or auto-classification) and runs a single `/plan` pass without critic review.

### Automated flow (`/run`)

```
/run → (discover?) → (architect?) → GATE → /thorough_plan → GATE → /implement → GATE → /review → GATE → /end_of_task
```

`/run` chains all phases automatically, pausing at each GATE for user confirmation. It accepts the same profile tags as `/thorough_plan` (`small:`, `medium:`, `large:`, `strict:`, `max_rounds: N`). Discover is skipped if recent (<7 days) discovery files exist. Architect is skipped for Small tasks. Each phase runs in its own subagent session.

### Task profiles

| Profile | Triggered by | Planning | Critic loop | Gate intensity | Typical cost |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Small** | `small:` prefix, or auto-classified + confirmed | Single `/plan` pass (Opus) | Skipped | Smoke → Standard → Full | ~$2.49 |
| **Medium** | `medium:` prefix, auto-classified, or no tag (default) | `/plan` (Opus) + critic loop with Sonnet `/revise-fast` | Up to 4 rounds | Smoke → Standard → Full | ~$2.99–$4.00 |
| **Large** | `large:` or `strict:` prefix | `/plan` (Opus) + critic loop with Opus `/revise` | Up to 5 rounds | Smoke → Full → Full | ~$4.65+ |

**Triage criteria at a glance:**
- **Small** — 1-3 files, single module, no integration risk, well-understood pattern (bug fix, config change, simple endpoint)
- **Medium** — multiple files across 1-2 modules, moderate complexity, some integration points
- **Large** — cross-service/cross-repo, high risk, data migrations, auth changes, significant unknowns

When in doubt, default to Medium. The user can always override with an explicit tag.

Each stage feeds into the next, with `/gate` checkpoints requiring explicit human approval:
- `/init_workflow` bootstraps the workflow in a new project. Creates `.workflow_artifacts/` structure, configures permissions, runs `/discover`, generates quickstart guide. Run once per project. (Skills and rules are installed separately via `bash install.sh`.)
- `/discover` scans all repos and saves inventory, architecture overview, and dependency map to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/`. Run once on setup, re-run when repos change.
- `/architect` produces `architecture.md` with stages decomposed for planning (uses `/discover` output as baseline context)
- **GATE** — user reviews architecture, explicitly approves
- `/thorough_plan` triages the task and routes accordingly:
  - **Small:** runs `/plan` (Opus) as a single pass → produces `current-plan.md` → smoke gate → done
  - **Medium:** runs the plan→critic→revise convergence loop (Opus plan, Sonnet revise, Opus critic, max 4 rounds)
  - **Large:** runs the convergence loop in strict mode (all Opus, max 5 rounds)
  - Override with `max_rounds: N` for any profile (ignored for Small)
- `/run` chains the entire workflow end-to-end: discover (if stale) → architect (if not Small) → thorough_plan → implement → review → end_of_task. Pauses at each gate for user confirmation. Accepts same profile tags as `/thorough_plan`. Use when you want the full pipeline in one command.
- **GATE** — automated checks (plan completeness, risk coverage), user reviews plan, explicitly approves
- `/implement` executes tasks from the converged plan, writing code and tests
- **GATE** — automated checks (scope depends on task profile — Standard for Small/Medium, Full for Large)
- `/review` verifies implementation against the plan, checking quality and safety (always Opus)
- **GATE** — Full checks: review verdict is APPROVED, full test suite passes, no conflicts, user approves
- `/end_of_task` — user explicitly accepts the work. Commits remaining changes, pushes branch to remote, prompts for lessons learned, marks task complete. Does NOT create a PR — that's a separate explicit action.
- `/rollback` is available at any point to safely undo implementation work

Not every task needs every stage. Small tasks typically skip `/architect` entirely. Bug fixes might only need `/implement` + `/review` (bypassing `/thorough_plan` entirely). But gates ALWAYS run between phases.

**CRITICAL RULE: `/implement` and `/end_of_task` require explicit user commands.** No skill may auto-invoke either. After `/thorough_plan` converges, the workflow STOPS and waits for `/implement`. After `/review` approves and the gate passes, the workflow STOPS and waits for `/end_of_task`. The user must consciously decide to start writing code AND to ship it.

**Exception: `/run` orchestrator.** When the user invokes `/run`, they have explicitly requested the full end-to-end pipeline. `/run` may invoke `/implement` and `/end_of_task` on the user's behalf, but still pauses at each gate checkpoint for confirmation before proceeding. The user's `/run` invocation constitutes the conscious decision; the gate confirmations provide the safety checkpoints.

Session lifecycle:
- `/start_of_day` — restores context from daily cache and checks git state. Run at the beginning of a work session.
- `/end_of_day` — saves session state and consolidates unfinished work into a daily cache. Run when wrapping up.
- `/weekly_review` — aggregates the week's progress into a structured review. Run on Friday (or whenever you want a week-level summary). Saves to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/weekly/`.

Multiple sessions can run in a day (parallel tasks). Each session writes its own state to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/`. `/end_of_day` rolls unfinished sessions into `.workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/<date>.md`.

## Task triage criteria

These criteria guide the auto-classification in `/thorough_plan` and help users choose the right explicit tag.

### Small
- Touches 1-3 closely related files in a single module
- No integration points affected (no API contract changes, no cross-service calls)
- Well-understood pattern: bug fix, config change, add simple endpoint, rename, typo fix
- Failure is localized — affects one feature, easy to detect and revert
- No data model changes, no auth changes, no shared-state modifications

### Medium (default when uncertain)
- Touches multiple files across 1-2 modules or services
- May affect integration points but contracts remain backward-compatible
- Some unknowns but similar work has been done in this codebase before
- Failure affects a subsystem but is contained and recoverable
- Adding a new feature with tests, refactoring a module, adding retry/resilience logic

### Large
- Touches multiple services, repos, or architectural layers
- Affects data consistency, authentication, authorization, or multi-service contracts
- Significant unknowns, new patterns, or involves migration of existing data/systems
- Failure could affect multiple services or all users
- Database migrations, auth overhauls, API versioning, payment flow changes

**Rule: when the classification is ambiguous, choose Medium.** It is the safe default — the critic loop catches issues that a single-pass plan might miss, at a modest cost premium.

## Session independence

**Each skill is designed to run in its own chat session.** Context windows fill up — this is expected. The file-based artifacts (`current-plan.md`, `critic-response-N.md`, session state, `architecture.md`, etc.) ARE the shared memory between sessions.

**Recommended session pattern:**
- One command per session for heavy work (`/architect`, `/thorough_plan`, `/implement`, `/review`)
- **`/run` gets its own session.** It orchestrates subagent sessions for each phase, so it stays lean — but start it fresh so the orchestrator has maximum context for managing the full pipeline.
- **Always run `/end_of_task` in a fresh session** if the current session has been through heavy work. The skill has 8 sequential steps that must all complete — context compaction mid-skill can silently skip steps like archiving.
- Short flows can share a session (`/plan` → `/implement` → `/review` for a small bug fix)
- Use your judgment: when context feels heavy, close and start fresh

**Every skill must be self-bootstrapping.** When a skill starts in a fresh session, it must:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for shared rules
2. Read `.workflow_artifacts/memory/lessons-learned.md` for past insights (planning/review skills)
3. Read the task subfolder artifacts it needs (`.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/current-plan.md`, `architecture.md`, `critic-response-N.md`, etc.)
4. Read `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/<latest>` for current session state if resuming
5. Read actual source code — never rely on a previous session's memory of the code

The user should never have to re-explain context that's already in the files. If a skill can't find what it needs, it asks the user — but the default is to read from disk.

**When closing a session:** any skill that did meaningful work should update the session state file (`.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/<date>-<task-name>.md`) before the session ends. This is the handoff to the next session.

## Common rules for all skills

### Integration analysis

Every skill that touches planning or review must analyze integrations. When a change affects how services, modules, or systems interact:

1. **Map the integration points** — identify every boundary crossed (HTTP calls, message queues, shared databases, file systems, event buses)
2. **Assess failure modes** — what happens when each integration fails? Timeout? Error? Stale data?
3. **Check backward compatibility** — can this change deploy independently, or does it require coordinated deployment?
4. **Verify contracts** — request/response formats, error codes, authentication headers
5. **Consider data consistency** — especially across multiple stores or services

### Risk de-risking

All planning and review work must actively de-risk:

- Identify unknowns and propose spikes/POCs to resolve them before full implementation
- Prefer feature flags for risky changes so they can be toggled without a deploy
- Plan for parallel running of old and new code paths during migration
- Ensure monitoring and alerting exist (or are planned) for new integration points
- Define rollback plans for every significant change

### Git workflow

#### Branch hygiene before new tasks

Before starting any new task on a repo, always:

1. Check if the repo is on another branch with uncommitted changes
2. Commit (or stash) those changes first
3. Switch to main/master
4. Fetch and pull to ensure it's up to date
5. Create a new branch for the task

Clean working state before each task avoids mixing unrelated changes and working on stale code. At the start of every implementation task, run `git status` + `git branch` on each affected repo. Handle any dirty state before proceeding. This applies to ALL repos involved, not just the primary one.

#### Commit messages

When the user asks to commit changes, write clear, conventional commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<body — what changed and why, not what files were edited>

<footer — references, breaking changes>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

The body should explain the "why" — the motivation for the change, not a list of files modified (the diff shows that).

#### Pull requests

PR creation is always an explicit, separate user action — never auto-created by `/end_of_task`. When the user asks to create a PR, before doing so:

1. **Run all tests** for the affected code areas
2. **Check for untested new code** — if tests are missing, flag it. If the plan specified tests, write them before the PR.
3. **Self-review the diff** — read `git diff <base>...HEAD` completely. Look for:
   - Debug code, console.logs, commented-out code
   - Missing error handling
   - Hardcoded values that should be configurable
   - Security issues (exposed secrets, injection vulnerabilities)
   - Accidental file inclusions (.env, node_modules, etc.)
4. **Call the planner for tests if needed** — if significant new code lacks tests and writing them is non-trivial, escalate to `/thorough_plan` to plan the test strategy before writing them

PR description format:
```markdown

- <What was tested and how>
- <How to run the tests>

## Integration impact

## Related
- Plan: .workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/current-plan.md
- Architecture: .workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/architecture.md (if applicable)
- Review: .workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/review-N.md (if applicable)
```

### Web research

When answering complex questions or designing systems:
- Search for best practices with specific technologies involved
- Check official documentation for APIs and frameworks
- Look for known issues, migration guides, or deprecation notices
- Find examples of similar architectures in open source

Don't guess about external system behavior — verify it.

### Daily insight capture

As you work through any task, watch for patterns, surprises, and friction points worth remembering. When you notice one, write it to the daily insights scratchpad immediately — do not wait for `/end_of_day`:

```
.workflow_artifacts/memory/daily/insights-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
```

Write an entry when you encounter:
- A gotcha that cost time and would cost time again (e.g., "this API silently ignores malformed requests")
- A non-obvious pattern in this codebase (e.g., "all services use X pattern for Y")
- A decision whose rationale is non-obvious and will be forgotten by tomorrow
- A workflow step that felt wrong or slow (mark `Applies to: workflow` — this becomes a Tier 3 suggestion at end of day)
- Any moment you think "I wish I'd known this earlier in the session"

**Write without asking the user first.** This is your scratchpad. Keep entries short (2-4 sentences). Tag each with `Promote?: yes | maybe | no` based on how reusable it seems across future sessions.

Do NOT use the insights scratchpad for task progress tracking — that belongs in `.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/<date>-<task>.md`.

You can also invoke `/capture_insight` explicitly to log something the user calls out mid-task.

### Lessons learned

The file `.workflow_artifacts/memory/lessons-learned.md` accumulates insights from completed tasks. It captures what surprised us, what went wrong, and what to do differently next time.

**Reading:** Every planning skill (`/plan`, `/critic`, `/architect`) should read `lessons-learned.md` at the start to avoid repeating known mistakes.

**Writing:** Append a new entry after each task reaches merge (or after a rollback, or when the user shares a lesson). Format:

```markdown
## <date> — <task-name>
**What happened:** <the surprise, failure, or insight>
**Lesson:** <the reusable takeaway>
**Applies to:** <which skills should pay attention — /plan, /critic, /implement, etc.>
```

Keep entries concise — 2-4 lines each. This file grows over time and becomes the team's institutional memory.

### Session state tracking

Every skill that does meaningful work (architect, plan, critic, revise, implement, review, run) should update the session state file as it progresses. Write or update:

```
.workflow_artifacts/memory/sessions/<date>-<task-name>.md
```

At minimum, update the `Current stage`, `Completed in this session`, and `Unfinished work` sections as tasks complete. This way, if the session is interrupted, `/end_of_day` (or the next `/start_of_day`) has accurate state to work from.

Don't obsess over keeping this perfectly up to date on every micro-step — update it at natural checkpoints (after completing a plan, finishing a critic round, implementing a task, etc.).

The session state file template includes a `## Cost` section:

```markdown
## Cost
- Session UUID: <UUID obtained from JSONL filename approach — see Cost tracking rules>
- Phase: <phase>
- Recorded in cost ledger: yes/no
```

This is informational — the cost ledger (`.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md`) is the source of truth for per-session costs.

### Cost tracking

Every skill that does meaningful work should record its session to the task's cost ledger at the start of the session. This enables `/end_of_task` to aggregate the total cost of a task across all sessions, including sessions that crashed or were force-closed.

**Step 1: Obtain the session UUID (JSONL filename approach — primary method)**

The Claude Code runtime writes a JSONL file for the active session at `~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/`. The filename is `<uuid>.jsonl`. Since the active session's JSONL is written to continuously, it is always the most recently modified file:

```bash
# Determine project hash: project folder path with / replaced by -
# Example: /Users/alice/projects/myapp → Users-alice-projects-myapp
ls -t ~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -1
# Extract UUID: strip directory path and .jsonl extension
```

If no `.jsonl` file is found (rare — session hasn't made an API call yet), use `unknown-<ISO-timestamp>` as the UUID. If the `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` environment variable is set (future Claude Code versions may add this), use it as an alternative — but do not depend on it being present.

**Step 2: Append to the cost ledger**

Append one line to `.workflow_artifacts/<task-name>/cost-ledger.md`:

```
<session-uuid> | <YYYY-MM-DD> | <phase> | <primary-model> | task | <brief note>
```

If the ledger file doesn't exist yet, create it with the header line first:
```
# Cost Ledger — <task-name>
```

**Phase values:** `discover`, `architect`, `plan`, `critic`, `revise`, `implement`, `review`, `gate`, `end-of-task`, `run-orchestrator`, `thorough-plan`, `rollback`, `init-workflow`, `start-of-day`, `end-of-day`, `weekly-review`, `capture-insight`, `triage`, `ad-hoc`

**Category:** Always write `task`. The user may manually edit the ledger to change a row to `off-topic` if a session drifted from the task. Skills do NOT auto-detect off-topic work.

**The cost ledger is append-only during a task.** Never delete or rewrite rows.

**Conditional skills:** `/discover`, `/gate`, `/start_of_day`, `/capture_insight`, and `/triage` should only record to the cost ledger if a task name is clearly determinable from context (a task folder path or explicit task name was passed). If no task context is active, skip cost recording silently.

### Asking questions

It's always better to ask than to assume. Use the AskUserQuestion tool when:
- The requirement is ambiguous
- There are multiple valid approaches with different tradeoffs
- You need domain-specific knowledge the code doesn't reveal
- The decision has significant downstream impact

Keep questions specific and pointed. Don't ask "what do you want?" — ask "should the retry logic use exponential backoff (safer, slower recovery) or fixed intervals (simpler, faster recovery)?"

### Knowledge cache

The workflow maintains a hierarchical file-based knowledge cache under `.workflow_artifacts/cache/`. This cache provides structured summaries of source code files and modules, enabling skills to navigate the codebase without re-reading unchanged source files.

#### Cache directory structure

````
.workflow_artifacts/cache/
├── _index.md                     ← Root index: repo list, last-updated timestamps
├── _staleness.md                 ← Git HEAD tracking per repo (replaces repo-heads.md)
├── <repo-name>/
│   ├── _index.md                 ← Repo summary: purpose, stack, entry points, key patterns
│   ├── _deps.md                  ← External deps + internal cross-module deps
│   └── <directory>/
│       ├── _index.md             ← Module/directory summary: purpose, exports, patterns
│       └── <file-stem>.md        ← Per-file summary (key files only)
````

#### Cache entry format

Every `_index.md` and `<file-stem>.md` uses this structure:

````markdown
---
path: <relative path from project root to source file/directory>
hash: <git hash of file at time of caching, or HEAD for directories>
updated: <ISO timestamp>
updated_by: <skill that wrote/updated this entry>
tokens: <approximate token count of this cache entry>
---

## Purpose
<1-2 sentences>

## Key Exports
- `name(params)` — description

## Dependencies
- imports from: <internal modules>
- external: <key packages>

## Patterns
- <notable patterns>

## Integration Points
- exposes: <APIs, events, exports>
- consumes: <APIs, events, imports>

## Notes
<gotchas, tech debt, non-obvious details>
````

Sections may be omitted when not applicable (e.g., a config file has no Key Exports).

#### Token budgets

| Entry type | Target tokens | When to create |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Root `_index.md` | 100-200 | Always (one per project) |
| Repo `_index.md` | 200-300 | Always (one per repo) |
| Repo `_deps.md` | 100-200 | Always (one per repo) |
| Module `_index.md` | 150-300 | Directories with 3+ source files |
| File `<stem>.md` | 50-150 | Key files only: entry points, APIs, models, configs, complex logic |

Rule of thumb: source files < 50 lines go into the module `_index.md` instead of getting their own entry. Source files > 500 lines may use up to 200 tokens.

#### Staleness tracking

`_staleness.md` tracks the git HEAD per repo at the time of last cache update:

````markdown
| Repo | HEAD | Updated |
|------|------|---------|
| <repo-name> | <full SHA> | <ISO timestamp> |
````

Skills check staleness by comparing `git rev-parse HEAD` against the stored value. If HEAD differs, `git diff --name-only <cached-head> <current-head>` identifies exactly which files changed. Cache entries for unchanged files remain valid.

#### Behavioral rules

1. **Cache is advisory, not authoritative.** Skills may always read source files directly. A missing or stale cache entry is never an error — the skill just reads from source (current behavior).
2. **Any skill that **modifies** a source file MUST update the cache entry via the write-through pattern below. Skills that only read source MAY update a stale or missing cache entry as a side effect (best-effort), but are not required to.**
3. **Cache writes must not block or fail the skill.** If a cache write fails (disk full, permission error), warn and continue.
4. **Skills should load cache entries in deterministic order** (root index, then repo indexes, then module indexes) to maximize prompt cache hits.
5. **`_staleness.md` is the successor to `repo-heads.md`.** Skills that previously read `repo-heads.md` should read `_staleness.md` instead. For backward compatibility, if `_staleness.md` does not exist, fall back to `repo-heads.md`.
6. **Rollback:** Deleting `.workflow_artifacts/cache/` restores pre-cache behavior. No skill should fail if the cache directory is missing.

See '**Cache-read bootstrap pattern**' and '**Cache write-through pattern**' below for the canonical instruction blocks that skills adapt into their SKILL.md.

#### Cache-read bootstrap pattern

Skills that consult the cache at session bootstrap should follow this pattern. The exact language in each SKILL.md may adapt it to the skill's context, but the logical steps must match.

1. **Guard** — If `.workflow_artifacts/cache/_index.md` does not exist, skip all cache steps and fall through to direct source reads (preserves pre-cache behavior for new installs or after cache deletion).

2. **Read staleness file** — Read `.workflow_artifacts/cache/_staleness.md`. If absent, fall back to `.workflow_artifacts/memory/repo-heads.md` for backward compatibility. If neither exists, treat all repos as stale.

3. **Per-repo staleness check** — For each repo relevant to the current task, compare `git rev-parse HEAD` against the hash stored in `_staleness.md`.

4. **Non-stale repos — load cache in deterministic order** — Read cache entries in this order: root `_index.md` → repo `_index.md` → repo `_deps.md` → module `_index.md` for task-relevant directories → file-level `<stem>.md` for task-relevant files. Deterministic order keeps the session prefix stable, maximizing Anthropic prompt-cache hit rates.

5. **Stale repos — targeted source reads** — Run `git diff --name-only <cached-head> <current-head>` to identify changed files. Trust cache entries for files NOT in that set. Read source directly for files in the changed set that are relevant to the current task.

Cache entries are context aids, not authoritative content. Skills that need exact code content (e.g., `/implement` before modifying a file, `/review` reading diffs) always read source regardless of cache state.

**Note on per-skill copies:** Each skill's SKILL.md today contains its own inline version of this pattern, adapted to its job. This section is the canonical reference. When updating the pattern globally, update each SKILL.md individually — subagents read their own SKILL.md at startup, not CLAUDE.md (see lessons-learned 2026-04-13). Do not attempt to replace per-skill inline copies with a pointer to this section; they must remain self-contained.

#### Cache write-through pattern

Any skill that modifies, creates, or deletes source files should update the knowledge cache to match. Today only `/implement` does this; the pattern below is the shared reference for any future skill that also writes source.

**When to update:** After each task commit (not after every individual file edit — batch by commit). Cache updates are best-effort; never block or fail a commit because of a cache write error.

**Guard:** Skip entirely if `.workflow_artifacts/cache/` does not exist or `_index.md` is absent. Cache writes only make sense against an existing, initialized cache.

**File operations:**

- **Modified file:** After editing, read the file fresh (post-edit content). Write or overwrite the cache entry at `.workflow_artifacts/cache/<repo>/<dir>/<file-stem>.md` using the standard frontmatter + sections format defined in the "Cache entry format" section above. Use the post-commit `git rev-parse HEAD` (repo-level SHA, not per-file blob) as the `hash` field — staleness is tracked at repo level via `_staleness.md`. Set `updated_by` to the skill name. Target density: 50–150 tokens.

- **New file:** Create the cache entry at the same path convention. Ensure the parent directory exists (`mkdir -p` via Bash or rely on the Write tool, which creates parent dirs automatically).

- **Deleted file:** Delete the corresponding cache entry file. Leave the parent module `_index.md` intact — its content remains valid until the next `/discover` rescan.

**`_staleness.md` update:** After all file-level cache writes, update the row for the affected repo in `.workflow_artifacts/cache/_staleness.md`. Set `HEAD` to the post-commit `git rev-parse HEAD` and `Updated` to the current ISO timestamp. If `_staleness.md` does not yet have a row for this repo, add one. If the file does not exist, create it with this header first:

```
| Repo | HEAD | Updated |
|------|------|---------|
```

**Error handling:** Cache writes are best-effort. On any failure (disk full, permission error, etc.), log a warning and continue — never fail the task or skip a commit because of a cache write error.

**Note on per-skill copies:** `/implement`'s SKILL.md (section "Cache write-through") is the concrete implementation of this pattern for the current workflow. Future skills that modify source must read this canonical section AND add their own inline cache-write instructions to their SKILL.md — subagents read their own SKILL.md, not CLAUDE.md (see lessons-learned 2026-04-13).

| /discover | Opus | Cross-repo scanning, understanding how services connect |
| /architect | Opus | Deep exploration, complex reasoning, cross-repo analysis |
| /plan | Opus | Detailed planning requires strong reasoning (always Opus — strong foundation reduces iteration) |
| /critic | Opus | Finding real issues requires deep understanding (never tiered) |
| /revise | Opus | Addressing critic feedback requires strong reasoning (used in strict mode) |
| /revise-fast | Sonnet | Cost-efficient revision (used by /thorough_plan in normal mode, rounds 2+) |
| /thorough_plan | Opus | Orchestrates task triage and plan→critic→revise loop. Routes Small tasks to single-pass /plan; Medium uses Sonnet /revise-fast; Large/strict: uses all-Opus. Critic always Opus. |
| /run | Opus | End-to-end orchestrator managing phase transitions, user checkpoints, and subagent dispatch. Needs strong reasoning for conditional logic and error recovery. |
| /implement | Sonnet | Efficient code generation, plan already defines what to do |
| /review | Opus | Thorough analysis, integration safety, risk assessment |
| /gate | Sonnet | Automated checks and human approval checkpoint |
| /rollback | Sonnet | Safe undo of implementation phases |
| /end_of_task | Sonnet | Commit, push branch, lessons, mark complete |
| /end_of_day | Haiku | Session state capture and daily cache consolidation (structured template work) |
| /init_workflow | Opus | Project bootstrap, /discover invocation, structure creation |
| /start_of_day | Haiku | Context restoration and git state reconciliation (structured checklist) |
| /weekly_review | Haiku | Aggregates weekly progress, decisions, and outcomes (template-driven) |
| /capture_insight | Haiku | Quick insight logging to daily scratchpad during task work |
| /cost_snapshot | Haiku | Read-only cost reporting from ledger files and ccusage (lightweight) |
| /triage | Haiku | Lightweight routing: reads prompt, inspects state, proposes a skill. |
